DBD::PgPP
=========

DBD::PgPP - Pure Perl PostgreSQL driver for the DBI.

DBD::PgPP is a Pure Perl client interface for the PostgreSQL database.  This
module implements the PostgreSQL client/server network protocol, so you
don't need an external PostgreSQL client library like "libpq" for it to
work. That means you can connect to a PostgreSQL server from operating
systems to which PostgreSQL has not been ported. How nifty!


DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  DBI
  IO::Socket


OPERATING SYSTEMS SUPPORTED BY 'DBD::PgPP':
-------------------------------------------

This module has been tested on these OSes.

  * Mac OS 9 with MacPerl5.6.1r1 built for PowerPC
  * Mac OS X with perl 5.6.0 buildt for darwin
  * Windows2000 with ActivePerl5.6.1 buildt631
  * FreeBSD4.6 with perl5.6.1 built for i386-freebsd
  * FreeBSD3.4 with perl5.005_03 & perl5.6.1 built for i386-freebsd
  * Linux with perl5.005_03 built for ppc-linux
  * Linux with perl5.6.1 on i386
  * Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.6.1 built for sun4-solaris
  * Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.004_04 built for sun4-solaris

# This list is the environment which I can use by the test usually.
# DBD::PgPP will operate also in much environment which is not
# in a list.

Can use on Solaris2.6 with perl5.004_04, although 'make test' is
failure.



INSTALLATION:
-------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note:
   A part of tests are skipped in the system which used a
   DES-base crypt(). if this is the other authentication methods,
   (like 'trust', 'password', 'md5') it will operate correctly.

   When using 'md5' authentication, if there is no 'Digest::MD5'
   module, MD5 will be calculated inside. However, it recommends
   that it installs 'Digest::MD5' module since this is a low speed.


TESTING:
--------

The tests are designed to connect to a live database. The following
environment variables must be set for the tests to run:

PG_TEST_DB=<database>
PG_TEST_USER=<user>
PG_TEST_PASS=<password>
PG_TEST_HOST=<hostname>*

PG_TEST_HOST is optional. When this is not specified, it connects
with UNIX socket of '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'.


LIMITATION:
-----------

  * Can't use 'crypt' authentication in a DES-based crypt().
  * Can't use the 'Kerberos v4/5' authentication.
  * Can't use the SSL Connection.
  * Can't use BLOB data.


BUG REPORT:
-----------

Wne a problem is found, append the following elements and give
mail to <oyama@module.jp>.

  * The version and platform of Perl which are used.
  * The version and platform of PostgreSQL server.
  * All the error messages generated with the problem.
  * The sample code which can reproduce the problem.
