Revision history for Perl extension DBD::PgPP.

0.05  Sun May  9 11:55:35 UTC 2004
        - All known bugs fixed:
           * No "can't locate method" exceptions when your query has an
             error
           * Permit executing a prepared handle more than once
           * Correctly handle empty strings in result rows
           * No infinite loop for long result rows
           * Permit more than eight columns in a result set
           * False Boolean values in results are false in your Perl code
             (not 'f').  This constitutes a change in behaviour, but one
             that's so obviously the right thing that I haven't created an
             option to give you the broken behaviour.
           * Demangle bytea data in results
           * Correctly quote placeholder values containing backslashes
           * Actually issue a BEGIN when a transaction starts, so that
             rollback can roll changes back
         - Unfortunately, the test suite has not yet been updated to
           trigger all these bugs.  Since it's nearly two years since the
           last release of DBD::PgPP, I thought it better to get these
           crucial bugfixes out the door soon; the test suite is my next
           priority for 0.06 and beyond.  So there may still be bugs in
           this code.  However, I've been using this version for a while
           now in a project for a customer, so I'm fairly confident that
           at least the bits I use are correct.
        - This release prepared by new co-maintainer Aaron Crane <arc@cpan.org>
