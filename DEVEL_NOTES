Notes for anyone hoping to do DBD::PgPP development or maintenance work
=======================================================================

Source repository
-----------------

The code is hosted on GitHub, which should hopefully make it easy for others
to contribute.  The clone URL is:

  git://github.com/arc/dbd-pgpp.git

Feel free to fork and send me a pull request.

DBI driver prefix registration
------------------------------

This apparently hasn't been done.  It's not hard: email the dbi-dev list and
ask for a prefix to be registered.  But I want to get this code released
without waiting for that to happen.

Debugging protocol interaction
------------------------------

Your DSN may include, a `debug=1` parameter, thus:

    dbi:PgPP:dbname=blah;debug=1

That enables printing out the type of every packet sent and received, to
standard output (or, more precisely, to Perl's current default output
filehandle).

If you additionally want to see a dump of every packet, set
$DBD::PgPP::Protocol::DEBUG to a true value:

    $DBD::PgPP::Protocol::DEBUG = 1;

It would be good if such debugging messages were better integrated with
DBI's built-in tracing facility, but it's slightly non-trivial (because the
code that emits the debug messages doesn't have a DBI handle available) and
I don't want it to delay the release any further.

Test suite
----------

You may consider it peculiar that the test suite is in, essentially, two
halves.  It is indeed a peculiar situation.  The explanation is that the
current maintainer planned to replace the existing test suite with one
stolen largely from DBD::Pg, but he turned out to be too feckless to get
very far with that plan.  So the original test suite is still in place, with
a new one sitting next to it; neither has particularly good coverage.
