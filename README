DBD::PgPP version 0.01
=====================

DBD::PgPP - Pure Perl PostgreSQL driver for the DBI.

DBD::PgPP is a Pure Perl client interface for the PostgreSQL database.
This module implements network protocol between server and client of
PostgreSQL, thus you don't need external PostgreSQL client library
like "libpq" for this module to work. It means this module enables you
to connect to PostgreSQL server from some operation systems which
PostgreSQL is not ported. How nifty!
